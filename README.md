# Cube-Converter
Here is a simple Diablo 3 Cube converter macro. For speedy upgrade items or whatever tab you select. 
; Coordinates based on 1920x1080 monitor resolution, if any other, XY positions will need to be changed, you can use MousePos (google it)
; Upgrading runs left to right starting from the upper left inventory slot, then jumps to the next row
; F1 starts, F3 resets (cancels) the script if running, F5 exits. Change as needed.
